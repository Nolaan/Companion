 Companion

Companion is mainly a GUI to flash your development board.

Companion is a program utility main focused on Embedded System Development.

The aim of the project is to ease the development cycle of embedded systems.
By wrapping the commandline tools used to flash the board and obtain its 
status into a GUI.

Currently only the Nvidia Jetson TK1 board (pm375) is supported.
Soon it will also be compatible with the Raspberry Pi.

This is an early version that may contain some bugs, provided without warranty.
